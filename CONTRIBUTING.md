# You're here?!
Phantastic, phenomenal, phiddle!

If you want to contribute to this project, you are more than welcome to do so!

It started as a project to try out a few things for fun, with little or no thought of going public/be used by others than me.
If you find anything that stands out in the code as being badly designed, illogical or just weird - you're probably right.
That being said, here's a few points that would be awesome if you consider if you, by any chance, are interested in the project:

* Read the Readme to get an idea of the functionality and ideas behind it. A brief explanation of code is there too.
* Any improvements are most welcome, I want to learn and perhaps other can too! That goes for both workflow, architecture, code, use of libraries and you name it.
* The Mac part is my weak spot (I'm new developing on the platform and using MS toolchain on top of it does not improve learning curve for me). Any input in this area is extra welcome!
* Don't hesitate to contact me if you have questions or feedback.

Enjoy!

Kind regards,
